# Noir

Noir is an open-source, GitHub-powered markdown based note-taking app for Android. It’s designed for developers and writers who prefer editing notes locally (in your fav text editor) and syncing them with GitHub - making GitHub the single source of truth.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Noir aims to bring the power of local-first note-taking with GitHub-backed syncing to mobile devices. Think of it as Obsidian meets GitHub, in your pocket.

## 📱 Features (Planned)

- 📂 Browse GitHub repo as a note vault (folder-based UI like Obsidian)

- 📝 View and edit markdown files

- 🔁 Two-way sync with GitHub

- 💅 Local-first UX with offline support

- 🖼️ Beautiful, minimal design

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- React native with expo

- Typescript

- Github API via OAuth 

- Custom made markdown rendering/editing engine
